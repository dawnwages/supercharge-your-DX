# (Workshop) Supercharge your Developer Experience with VS Code, Dev Containers and Codespaces
Supercharge your DX with VS Code and Dev Containers Workshop

## Set Up Instructions

### VS Code
Free and built on open source. Integrated Git, debugging and extesnsions. You have the option between VS Code Stable and Insiders which are installed side-by-side, which means you can switch between the two independently.

### Dev Containers

Dev Containers or "Development Containers" is an open spec for enriching containers with development specific content and settings. Created by Microsoft, it was first supported by VS Code but now supported by IntelliJ IDEA, Cochix devenv, Jetpack.io, Codespaces, DevPod [and more](https://containers.dev/supporting).

### Codespaces
Code spaces is a development environment that is hosted in the cloud. It's built with the same tools as VS Code and Dev Containers, but you now have cloud compute in a Docker container, running on a virtual machine. YOu chan chose your machine types and cores, ram and storage.

Note: You can do this demo with *any* Django repo on GitHub. Try it out!

## What you'll be building
You're going to walk away with a üí© ton of examples and save your own custom settings.

## FAQ
- By default VS Code Auto updates to new version.
- You can disable VS Code telemetry which removes the need for VSCodium while allowing you to use VS Code's full set of features.
- VS Code lets you control text indentation and whether you'd like to use spaces or tab stops. By default, VS Code inserts spaces & uses 4 spaces per tab key. VS Code will analyze your open file and determine indentation used in the document. The auto detection overrides indentation settings.
- [Workspace Trust](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/workspace-trust) lets you decide whether code in your folder can be executed by VS Code and extensions without your explicit approval. This allows for safe code browsing working in "Restricted Mode"
