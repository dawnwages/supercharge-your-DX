ðŸ“º [Activity] Linters
======================

Linting highlights semantic and stylistic problems in your Python source code and thus you're able to help identify programming errors. In VS Code for Python, this is done through installing your extension/linter of choice and now your linter and its opinions come through VS code and it's user interactions instead of just through the commanline. Syntax error detection is enabled by default in the Python extention's language server. You can use multiple linters at the same time.
