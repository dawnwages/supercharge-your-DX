================================================
If you do not have a codebase you feel comfortable perusing during the workshop, feel free to use the Djangonaut Space website codebase: [https://github.com/djangonaut-space/wagtail-indymeet](https://github.com/djangonaut-space/wagtail-indymeet)
- Start with the Python Extension: Leverages all of VS Code's power to provide auto complete, IntelliSense, Linting, Debugging and Unit Testing, along with the ability to switch between Python versions
- Select Interpreter
- Autocomplete + IntelliSense: Combines together a few features together including code completion and variable suggestions.
- "Code Actions"
